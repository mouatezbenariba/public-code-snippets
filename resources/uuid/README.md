# UUID Browser Ready Versions
I have noticed that the browser ready versions of [UUID](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid) made by [heikomat](https://github.com/heikomat/uuid-browser#readme) (the wzrd.in website seems not to work). So, I copied the code snippet of it. then, I made it available to load using [jsDelivr](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr) since GitHub doesn't allow source code to be accessed from their site like a CDN.
